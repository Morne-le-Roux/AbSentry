# AbSentry

AbSentry is an app built in Dart and Flutter intended to keep track of class attendance.
It was originally built for a single teacher to use but I am busy updating it to allow user login and cloud storage for multi-device and multi-user usage.
Even though it was meant for school attendance, it can be used for any group where attendance needs to be kept.


Absentry is still a work in progress. It is not usuable in it's current state. It does however take entries and saves this to a database, but there is no wat to retrieve the data as of yet.
I am also actively working on the backend side of things and entries on the test database(current default database) can be randomly deleted without any warning.
If you would like to use the app in its current state, you will have to link your own firebase database to it.
