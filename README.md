# AbSentry

Absentry is still a work in progress. It is not usuable in it's current state.

AbSentry is an app built in Dart and Flutter intended to keep track of class attendance.
It was originally built for a single teacher to use but I am busy updating it to allow user login and cloud storage for multi-device and multi-user usage.
Even though it was meant for school attendance, it can be used for any group where attendance needs to be kept.
